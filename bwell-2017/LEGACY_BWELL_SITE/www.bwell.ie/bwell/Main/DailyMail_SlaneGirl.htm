The usual sensationalism that seems more usual than unusual had the airwaves in a tizzy. But perhaps we need to do a 360 on this and see this as a microcosm of major issues we have in society that we need to address with regard to sexual and behavioural norms. More importantly to fully consider the impact on this girl's mental health to deal with such an irrevocable recording and to suggest the creation of new policy guidelines to not allow a broadcast of this nature in the future.<BR><BR>I feel for teenagers. Theirs is a difficult and complex world. Never have we had a more connected-disconnected generation. Some seem a bit lost, they may be engaging physically in sexual acts but not connecting emotionally. Sex is complicated as it affects us at a physical, psychological and emotional level. It would be fair to say a lot of adults struggle with the complexities of sex and relationships so it's no surprise adolescents do too. They make mistakes and bad decisions just like adults do.<BR><BR>Young teenagers are subjected to more sexualized images and messages than ever before which has lead to a coarsening of sexual values, beliefs and behaviour. All of which is also having a complex impact on their psychological and emotional well-being. If we look to what has lead to this paradigm shift a 2006 Australian study called 'Corporate<BR>Paedophilia' is helpful in providing an understanding to the confluence of factors. Corporate Paedophilia is metaphor to describe aggressively targeting children in sexualized ways through the medium of advertising and marketing that is both an abuse of children and public morality, think of Playboy slogan t-shirts for kids and padded bras<BR>for six year olds.<BR><BR>The old pattern that advertisers used was to inadvertently use older teens or young adults to portray more adult or sexualized messages to sell their product. But now they are targeting children and young teens directly. Our young people's brains are saturated and overloaded with sexualized images through every medium from TV, videos, magazines,<BR>billboards, online to their own social networking portals of peer comparison. As their brains become accustomed to the sexualized images advertisers have to keep upping the ante as the less explicit images have been desensitized and don't attract as much notice. As adolescents are inhabiting this increasingly sexualized world it really shouldn't come as so much of a surprise that they start to exhibit sexual behaviour.<BR><BR>Something we need to be aware of is just because today's teenagers sound and look more sophisticated and mature doesn't mean that they have the psychological maturity to deal with daily life. Seligman the father of Positive Psychology blames the 'Self-esteem' movement of the 80's whereby a course syllabus was introduced into primary schools with the good intent of increasing self-esteem. At race day everyone got a medal, at art class every child got a star. The unintended negative outcome of this was when those children hit secondary school they didn't have the resources to deal with failure, competition and the usual awkward and difficult transition that is becoming an adolescent. So although adolescents may be biologically mature and able to have sex they will not be psychologically mature until they are in their 20's and for boys until their late 20's. Added to this neurological time lag is that in terms of risk assessment the ability to self-regulate impulsive emotions doesn't fully mature until the late 20's for a boy.<BR><BR>So to put this in the context of this event where teenagers engaged in a sexual act and then it being posted online, it is this lack of self-control and self-regulation that makes pressing a button just far too easy and too fast. The visual impact of seeing a video on your brain is completely different to someone telling you this happened. This is where my concerns as a Psychologist turn to in terms of this not being acceptable to post. Who is thinking of the long term impact and consequences?<BR><BR>Adolescents need to be taught how to stop and think in that moment of how they would feel if someone posted a similar video of them. They need to imagine their parents, teachers grandparents, friends (and even their own children someday) seeing it. We need to be teaching cyber-manners and ultimately pro-social behaviour. As the ugly side of the internet, with "Trolls" and cyberbullying is faceless, spineless is another word. Where is our human empathy? Teaching self-responsibility of how to behave in public and at home to be fully engaged in what you share or post online. The one question people should ask is would they have said the things they said or made the comments back to this girls face? The answer is no, because as you would face someone you would read from their facial expression the intense feelings of remorse and shame.<BR><BR>There has been a coarsening in young girls' sexual beliefs and behaviours. It seems as if some girls think they need to be sexually explicit in how they dress and in their behaviour to be valued. The norm seems to be more sexualized, trying to project an image of being older and more mature which has been a rite of passage in adolescence time immemorial but when some 15 year olds can pass as a twenty-five year olds then something is amiss. Happy or joyful facial expressions seem to be swapped for the more sultry and sexy. <BR><BR>Who is championing adolescents to cultivate their strengths, their virtues and skill-based endeavours, as opposed to our all-consuming appearance driven society which promotes appearances and as the sole way of boosting self-esteem and self-identity.<BR><BR>There's also been an increase in explicitly sexual language - there are more sexual words and images from songs. You hear young children singing back the lyrics to you, and it doesn't sit very well. Back in the 80's, Madonna was one of the only people doing it - whereas now, tell me one female popstar who isn't in a leotard or her underwear? You don't see the same of male singers, you don't see them in their boxers singing. But it's literally par for the course; it has actually become boring because it is so predominant.</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD><TD style="BORDER-LEFT: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 19px; PADDING-RIGHT: 16px" vAlign=top width=425 align=right><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" align=right vAlign="top"><TBODY><TR><TD vAlign=top align=middle><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text><IMG title="" border=0 alt="" src="../Images/AllisonKeating.jpg"></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR vAlign=top><TD style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 29px; PADDING-LEFT: 29px; PADDING-RIGHT: 29px; PADDING-TOP: 29px" class=BgLoseWeightPale width="100%"><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text>I'm tired of the set formula for male and female videos. The female singer with as little clothes on as possible being as sexually explicit as possible and a usual scene for the male artist may be one man surrounded by a bevy of hot ladies. Snore. But regardless, images especially videos have a strong impact on how our minds and beliefs are shaped. This leads to thoughts and expectations whether conscious or unconscious that 'I should look like this, act like that' in order to be valued, liked and admired.<BR><BR>Young people seeing this are very impressionable. Even when Madonna had the cone boobs, she was still wearing trousers. It's the same with pornography. People are seeing pornography at a much younger age which may have a 'normalizing' affect of how sex is, putting pressure on not just the females but on men as well. Research shows relationships between pornography and women being the victim of violence and being correlated to achieving poorer academic and cognitive functioning. <BR><BR>Childhood is about innocence, and innocence is a lack of carnal knowledge. This is being taken away from children and adolescents and being contributed to by Corporate Paedophilia, accessibility to porn, and societal and peer expectations.<BR><BR>There's an impact on guys, as well. Their level of 'normal' is also changing; to be the lad, they might feel that to have to engage in this behaviour by treating women like sex objects. Increased pressure for their sexual performance akin to a porn star and yet lacking the ability to actually know how to be vulnerable with a female to show them the real you, to share hopes, fears and dreams. To not have real intimacy with a female is to lack the point of sex in the first place. This divide between sexual acts and the heart has lead to a disconnect and an increase in feeling isolated. This disconnect, is what I see more and more. You can't separate your heart and your head, and when you do, mental health issues arise. So overwhelming pressure, mixed messages and pressure to engage your body without your heart can only lead to issues at a deep psychological and emotional level. There is both a male and female impact to this 'pornification' of younger and younger children and adolescents.<BR><BR>When I heard about the Slane incident, I just thought about the girl - and thought how this could become more and more common. I feel frustrated because teenagers don't have the emotional self-regulation to avoid things like this in terms of pressing send. As mentioned above impulse control doesn't fully mature at a structural neurological level for boys until their around 27. So the danger of being in the moment is that herd mentality can take over. If that person was on their own they might reflect on the long term consequences. <BR><BR>When we have the dangers of social media, with no social responsibility, people don't think of the consequences in the same way, and there are far-reaching consequences. Regardless of the act or what happened, it's irresponsible to put something out there or allow it to go viral. When the print dries it will be forgotten in a week or two, but it won't be forgotten by this girl. I was thinking about her welfare. Many people make mistakes, but it doesn't need to become social (or traditional) media fodder. <BR><BR>There needs to be a change in policy. In terms of ask.fm and similar websites, it is heart-breaking trying to give some sort of psychological understanding to parents affected in the worst way. Our job as adults is to put safety measures in, where are the boundaries? There should be some level of constraint or oversight to inhibit posting of sexually graphic images or videos. A rethink is required now. When you have a heady mix of a concert, similar demographic and possibly lower inhibitions owing from various substances from drink to drugs, add impulsiveness and accessible wi-fi, you've got a recipe for disaster. At the end of the day, we're dealing with a person. Technology doesn't have a heart or a head, we have to put the humane into technology through guidelines that restrain this futile viral video. People and their mistakes shouldn't be used for quick entertainment, that is amoral. <BR><BR>We're also not teaching skills in school such as valuing yourself as an individual - for either guys or girls. They're struggling to form identities, and parents, too, are struggling to have control. But they need to step back in and say, "No - just because everyone else is doing something, that's not okay." Parents need to be the parent not their friend. Say it's not okay for you to stay out that late, wear that skirt, or non-existent shorts. Yes, teenagers have to take responsibility for themselves, but we can't just take the 'Slane Girl' case as an unfortunate event - at a bigger level, we need to think what actually led to this.<BR><BR>No matter what people say, there is a huge amount of peer pressure. The coarsening of beliefs - where attitudes, morals and values have changed - just because it's the norm doesn't mean everyone agrees with it. But they might go along with it. <BR><BR>At a practical level, our teenagers are looking sophisticated and talking sophisticated, but they don't have the psychological tools to deal with their challenging life. All I see is mental health issues getting worse and presenting earlier. <BR><BR>Value has to be placed back upon you as a person and within your own body; sex has to be placed back up on a higher level. Value needs to be derived from things you can change about yourself, we need to help our adolescents by increasing hope, self-efficacy and strength based skills. Sexual acts have to be actually graded again in terms of it being a big deal. Teenagers have to respect themselves and their bodies, actually understanding what real intimacy is - which is about really knowing someone and having a relationship. This needs to be taught. Sex education needs to be so much more than the biological act of sex, it is much deeper than that. We need to teach about intimacy and the complexity of physically and emotionally connecting to another human being and this starts with your mind. This needs to be happening in the home, at school, at a policy level, and where advertising and marketing regulatory bodies have the power and political will to impose sanctions upon those who cross the line. The time for change is here now, our focused intent needs to move away from the sensational and to a more of Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson’s "Broaden and Build" theory of helping our next generation flourish.<BR></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN><IMG title="" border=0 alt="" src="../Images/pdflogo-small.jpg"></SPAN></TD><TD><A class=CF-Page-Text href="../Files/slanedailymail.pdf" target="_blank">Download pdf of article here</A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><A class=CF-Page-Text href="MediaBase.htm">Back to main page</A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" align=center><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN class=verySmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 12px; PADDING-LEFT: 9px; PADDING-RIGHT: 9px; BORDER-TOP: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 12px" align=left><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD align=left><SPAN class=smallGrey edesc>bWell Clinic - 12 Saint James Terrace, Malahide, Co.
