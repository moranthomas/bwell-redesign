I am 39 years old and I recently gave birth to my second child. Last month, I was diagnosed with moderate post natal depression. I am lucky enough to have a brilliantly supportive husband and extended family. But I have never felt this low and listless before. My GP has suggested that I try anti-depressants. However, medication is a last resort – I would rather try other alternative methods so I can recover and enjoy my family properly. What sort of therapy do you recommend I try?</B></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><DIV></DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class=verysmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=CF-Page-Text><TD><SPAN edesc><B>A:</B> Post natal depression is probably far more common that the statistics state that it can affect 1 in every 6 women. This is reflective of why I personally feel women may experience PND as with most mental health issues there lies the fear of social stigma and this is especially true with motherhood. The extra fear of being perceived as weak, inadequate or not good enough as a mother, can leave many women suffering needlessly and in isolation. PND is as much a personal issue as it is societal, as part of the issue can be a feeling of not being able to admit that you have PND in the first place. If we did a quick free association on the word motherhood words such as caring, warm, protective may come up. Some words that are often omitted from the Disney-style version of motherhood word association are abject exhaustion, 70% hormonal change three days after birth (or colloquially known as 'day 3') and a huge change in self-esteem leading to a smacker punch in the belly of your confidence.<BR><BR>When I worked with people who experienced extreme trauma and post traumatic stress due to torture, the number one torture that was deemed the worst and I couldn't even write about how bad some of them were, was 'sleep deprivation'. After interviewing and treating hundreds of asylum seekers who had experienced torture firsthand I was very taken aback that this was the one that had the most impact. It is estimated that a mother losses seven hundred hours of sleep in the first year of having a baby. This is one I can relate to very well at the moment as I actually have bruises on my arm from basically sleep walking into the frame of the door to see whether it's the baby or toddler who is crying!<BR><BR>I don't know what type of birth experience you had but this can be a major contributor to PND. You may have had a very traumatic birth experience and this is something that can have a very deep psycho-spiritual impact as giving birth is such a sacred experience. I have treated many women from primary or secondary trauma due to their birth experience. If you had to have a C-Section this is also highly correlated to experiencing PND, or if your baby was unwell when he/she was born. If we look to the common denominator here it is definitely the sense of helplessness, and being out of control. Our modern day mother is used to literally achieving anything she sets her mind to. Nature can often present a dichotomy to this world view as you are not in control. If you had a very specific image of how you thought the birth would be the disappointment of this can be felt as a major sadness and loss. There can be a grieving over the loss of not having the birth you imagined.<BR><BR>This is not to make you feel any worse but I would encourage you to feel how you really feel. All too often mothers are basically out of the revolving door of the hospital with their head spinning, body aching and in bits and with a new-born utterly dependent upon you. I remember on our first, after an elective section due to a breech position my Doctor said that he thought it was so inhumane to hand a mother a newborn after major abdominal surgery. We need to open our hearts to mothers and give them the sacred space to experience the highs and yes lows of being a new mum. It is this allowance that will allow not only the physical but the emotional wounds to heal.<BR><BR>On a practical level, write out what it is that you feel so low about. I would be a major advocate of body dynamics in bringing these emotions to the forefront. To do this, talk to someone who will allow you express your emotions completely absent of judgement. If you feel you don't have someone to do this with seek out a mental health practitioner who has experience in this area.<BR><BR>On your own write out your experience but do this from the heart, with no censoring and no judgements such as 'I should be happy, I have a healthy baby'. These statements violate your right to process the deep feelings you may be experiencing. If you become upset stop, become aware of where you feel it in your body, place your hands there, this could be in your heart, your stomach or your throat and feel the feeling and allow it to come up, and have a great big ache relieving cry. There is nothing more cathartic than a cry when you specifically know why you are crying. With PND you may experience a lot of tears sometimes triggered by seemingly innocuous comments that normally you wouldn't be as sensitive to. But when you can identify the feeling(s) such as anger, sadness or loss this will help heal your emotions.<BR><BR>On a practical level there are certain things that will really help. Ensure that you get out at least once a day, even if you just walk around your estate. I know how tough this can be in the early days but make it a priority for you and your baby. If it doesn't happen just try and do it the next day. Find ways of getting more sleep. My mother in law came and slept in our house on two occasions and it really was an amazing gift.</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD><TD style="BORDER-LEFT: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 19px; PADDING-RIGHT: 16px" vAlign=top width=425 align=right><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" align=right vAlign="top"><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class=verysmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD vAlign=top align=middle><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text><IMG title="" border=0 alt="" src="../Images/AllisonKeating.jpg"></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR vAlign=top><TD style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 29px; PADDING-LEFT: 29px; PADDING-RIGHT: 29px; PADDING-TOP: 29px" class=BgLoseWeightPale width="100%"><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text>Here is a crucial one, get out on your own and get some exercise. I know only to well how tough this is when you are bleary eyed with tiredness but I promise you you will thank me for it after you have done your work-out. You are looking for high impact cardio, so bootcamp can be a great way to do this as you will be pushed much more than by yourself. Always get the all clear from your Doctor first and if you have had a section make sure the instructor knows this.<BR><BR>Eat yourself into a happier place, your body needs to be nourished and loved and give it good healthful food. Accept all offers of dinners, preferably dropped to your door! This will be received with much greater appreciation that another baby outfit your little one will out grow before it even gets one wear out of it!<BR><BR>Breathe, a crying baby has a very specific neurological impact on your physically and emotionally. Your body is in an acute state of arousal and awareness and your childs' cry has been specifically designed that you cannot ignore it. For any woman who has experienced colic I would highly recommend asking someone your mother, a friend, or a sister to take the baby if they are crying for a couple of hours. Remove yourself for even one hour and go for a walk and or a non interrupted cup of tea or coffee and even leaf through a magazine. You need head space, you will recharge your batteries by doing this. Get out with your partner, go for dinner, talk, breathe and have that time for each other.<BR><BR>In terms of sleeplessness, don't go anywhere near your computer at least one hour before bed, the electric magnetic light has negating impact on your brain's ability to release sleep hormones. Lavender oils can have a lovely relaxing impact as can sleep inducing tracks, I have a good one called 'bWell sound-asleep', my voice puts me to sleep!<BR><BR>These practical tips will definitely aid with your symptoms but therapy will release conscious and more often unconscious feelings, emotions and birth wounds. Give yourself a break, you are a magnificent woman who has brought a beautiful child into the world. Your body has had a huge physical experience, emotionally you will never be the same, you are now more vulnerable and yet you will experience such joy from your child as there is no love like it. But the reality of a new baby is that it is all encompassing, and even getting to the toilet, brushing your teeth and your hair can take a backseat until much later in the day that I'd care to admit!<BR><BR>Another little secret not usually talked about is how awful you can feel physically in your own appearance after you've had a baby. That beautiful bump is now more reminiscent of an 80 year olds crepey skin (apologies to any octogenarians!) You look exhausted, feel exhausted and I now really know why it's called beauty sleep. Small treats go a long way, a nice post-partum massage, getting your nails or hair done, it may sound superficial but for any woman who has just had a baby they will identify with the numerous benefits this can provide. A bit of quiet you-time where you come away feeling someone has looked after you. Self-esteem, personal identity and body image can take a battering these are things I would recommend you explore in therapy. Psychologists are the physicians of the soul and I think therapy post-partum should be standard to have time to discuss your experience in all hospitals after you have a child.<BR><BR>If you are having any issues bonding, therapy will help understand and heal any old wounds which may even relate back to your mother. Really express how you feel to your partner to help them understand what it is you are feeling and be a little patient if they don't as it's like you trying to understand what it is like to experience a hugely transformational male experience.<BR><BR>Being a mother isn't purely instinctive allow yourself to make mistakes, to learn and to grow into this role that will deepen your own personal life experience beyond recognition. As with most things in nature, it cannot be forced, let yourself grow into your new role as a mother of two, and with therapy and support you will come through this. Best of luck, and wishing you relief at this hard and yet wonderful time. Nature sure loves it's opposites, with kindest thought, Allison x<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><A class=CF-Page-Text href="AskAllison_Base.htm">Back to main page</A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" align=center><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN class=verySmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 12px; PADDING-LEFT: 9px; PADDING-RIGHT: 9px; BORDER-TOP: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 12px" align=left><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD align=left><SPAN class=smallGrey edesc>bWell Clinic - 12 Saint James Terrace, Malahide, Co.
