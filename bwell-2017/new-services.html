            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Generalised Anxiety Disorder can be defined as an unwarranted worry and over-analysing about everyday things. The excessive worry and overthinking can feel like it is consuming you. These thoughts or triggers can lead to psychosomatic symptoms such as shallow breathing, tight muscles, a nauseous stomach which can create a vicious cycle of thinking something is really wrong leading to more catastrophizing.</p>
                <p>It is called generalised anxiety as the individual can generalise the anxiety to everyday stresses and concerns over money, relationships, career and health. Normal daily routines and everything that feels outside of your control becomes a huge struggle and can sometimes feel overwhelming. This sense of being in a hyper-vigilant state can leave you feeling very frustrated with yourself and it can be normal to feel down, physically and emotionally exhausted and switching off can be very difficult and frustrating.</p>
                <p>A combination of CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), which is an evidence based solution focused form of therapy that helps you to become aware of how your thoughts are affecting you now and triggering anticipatory anxiety and provides you with Psychological tools to change your response, Psychodynamic therapy which looks to the past roots of the presenting issues and Positive Psychology which identifies help you apply your strengths in a daily mindful manner. All these therapies combine to help you understand where you have come from and where certain beliefs have originated from. How this may be affecting you now and then creating your own personal Psychological toolbox that you can use when you need it most.</p>

                <p>Anxiety can be provoked by stressful situations, (work, family, pace of life) a traumatic experience (a car crash, panic attack, accident, losing your job, break-up of a relationship) or there can be underlying generalised anxiety which you experience as part of your everyday life.
                    <br/> Anxiety responds really well to therapy. It is so common, affecting one in four. It can be quite a shock to experience anxiety especially if you have never experienced anything like it before. Taking the steps to change it can be daunting but therapy is a wonderful mechanism to help you feel like yourself again. </p>

                <p>Panic attacks are sudden, discrete periods of:
                    <br/>

                <ul>

                    <li>Although these episodes may appear random, they are considered to be a subset of an evolutionary response commonly referred to as fight or flight that occur out of context, flooding the body with hormones (particularly adrenalin) that aid in defending itself from harm.

                <p></p>
                <p>Relationships are a fundamental aspect of being a human being, they can bring immense pleasure but also have the propensity for immense pain. We are social beings and have a fundamental and evolutionary need to connect deeply. For real love to be experienced though we must âlet goâ and âallow inâ vulnerability. This can be a very scary prospect, the real act of intimacy, of letting people in, being present and engaged in the relationship and showing your ârealâ self, warts and all. Questions and fears arise âam I good enoughâ, âwill they like me if they know the real meâ along with past relationships and destructive patterns can be a daunting task for us all.</p>
                <p>Risk plays a huge part in attaining happiness and a wonderful piece of research by Robert Biwas-Diener looked at what âhappy people do differentlyâÂ <a href="http://bit.ly/2iJOgQm" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/2iJOgQm</a>Â and found that people who took risk were the happiest. It was this state of being curious, and uncertain about how it would turn out that linked in with experiencing more happiness. I think it makes a lot of sense in the context of relationships. The risk of really opening up has huge reward but also the potential to not work.</p>
                <p>There is so much information, often misguided about how to be a better communicator, lover or listener. We certainly never received a manual on the art of love and relationships. The nitty gritty of âhow toâ deal with conflict or âhow toâ communicate in a way that we feel heard and understood. We did learn though, for better or worse from the relationship our parents, our family role and previous relationships; psychodynamics patterns, beliefs and concepts of ourselves and our world that are integral to understanding yourself and your partner. Therapy can be a safe place to talk and understand these Psychodynamic roles and how and what your background brings to your relationship.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about research and there is such wonderful evidence based research about how to have a better relationship and marriage. These are the skills that we bring to the therapy table, or couch! As a Psychologist and not an umpire I want couples therapy to be based on practical, respectful ideas and concepts that you as a couple will feel heard, understood and prepared to catch your old reactive patterns of shutting down or lashing out to practical ways you can grow as a couple together. Love like happiness really needs to be nurtured and minded. We canât take love or each other for granted. Love and science are a good partners to nurture and grow a warm, connected relationship.</p>

                <p>I was lucky to hear Psychologist Dorothy Rowe speak about depression and the way she described it as a âprisonâ really struck a chord with me. That awful feeling of being stuck, trapped, enmeshed, alone and imprisoned in your mind. Our ethos on depression is to help you to identify and change negative depression spirals. To defeat rumination which is so strongly related with depression.</p>
                <p>It can be normal to feel down sometimes, this is not depression. We can help you through difficult episodes, equipping you with tools and techniques that can improve the quality of your life. We monitor and assess your thought processes and help you see how you can change destructive thought processes into constructive thoughts and emotions.</p>
                <p>We also really listen to those key words, and moments of sadness, loss and despair. We nurture with compassion focused therapy to heal, process and allow you to be. We incorporate mindfulness based cognitive therapy to recognise the frustrations of where you are, how you feel and the often distressing gap to where you want to be. Compassion, self-soothing techniques and emotion focused therapy are evidence based and soothing.</p>
                <p>The DSM (Diagnostic Statistical Manual) is a Psychological manual classifies depression as.</p>

                    <br/>We can define stress as a normal physiological response of the body to situations or stimulus which are perceived as 'dangerous' to the body. Stress can affect anyone and everyone at some point of time in their life. When it occurs frequently it affects health - both physical and mental.

                <p>At the bWell Clinic we have seen the ravaging effects of eating disorders on young women and men. We hope to offer a practical light and plan of action to people suffering from the various types of eating disorders.</p>
                <p>Building the clientsâ awareness of the destructive nature of the disease and re-forming the self-concept and self and body image that is constructive to leading a healthy physical, emotional and Psychological state of being. Small steps to progress and help the client see the âperceivedâ self and real self.</p>
                <p>Eating Disorders are a very serious and prevalent problem in our society today affecting both genders from as young as seven to late adulthood. With new worrying statistics showing mothers and women over 35 as a risk group. The manifestation of eating disorders is an outward expression of an individual experiencing immense internal emotional and psychological pain and confusion. For the sufferer it may appear that food and the controlling behaviours are the main concern for the individual but the serious and sometimes fatal behaviours has lead anorexia nervosa to be rated as the highest form of death and suicide in mental health problems.</p>
                <p>âAnorexia is thought to have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, with approximately 10% of those who are diagnosed with the disorder eventually dying due to related causes. The suicide rate of people with anorexia is also higher than that of the general population and is thought to be the major cause of death for those with the condition.â

                    <br/>It is important for duty of care to the client to take a multi-disciplinary approach to Anorexia and we collaborate with your GP and Psychiatrist.</p>

                <p>
                    <br/>Anorexia nervosa is a Psychiatric diagnosis that describes an eating disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. Individuals with anorexia often control body weight by voluntary starvation, purging, vomiting, excessive exercise, or other weight control measures, such as diet pills and or laxatives. It primarily affects adolescent females, however approximately 10% of people with the diagnosis are male and this is a growing and worrying trend. Anorexia nervosa is a complex condition, involving psychological, neurobiological, and sociological components.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Diagnosis and clinical features of Anorexia Nervosa
                    <br/>
                    <br/>The most commonly used criteria for diagnosing anorexia nervosa are from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)
                    <br/>To be diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa, according to the DSM-IV-TR, a person must display:
                    <br/>
                    <br/> </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected).</li>
                    <li>Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese</li>
                    <li>Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.</li>
                    <li>In women who have had their first menstrual period but have not yet gone through menopause (post-menarcheal, premenopausal females), the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles (amenorrhea).</li>
                    <li>Or other eating related disorders.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <br/>Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR specifies two subtypes:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Restricting Type: during the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has not regularly engaged in binge eating or purging behaviour (that is, self-induced vomiting, over-exercise or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas)
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Binge-Eating Type or Purging Type: during the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in binge-eating OR purging behaviour (that is, self-induced vomiting, over-exercise or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Physical
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Anorexia nervosa can put a serious strain on many of the body's organs and physiological resources particularly on the:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Structure and function of the heart and cardiovascular system.</p>
                <p>Typically there can be a disturbed electrolyte balance</p>
                <p>Particularly low levels of phosphate, which has been linked to heart failure, muscle weakness, immune dysfunction, and ultimately death.</p>
                <p>Those who develop anorexia pre-adulthood may suffer stunted growth and subsequent low levels of essential hormones (including sex hormones) and chronically increased cortisol levels.</p>
                <p>Osteoporosis can also develop as a result of anorexia in 38-50% of cases</p>
                <p>Poor nutrition leads to the retarded growth of essential bone structure and low bone mineral density.</p>
                <p>Anorexia does not harm everyone in the same way. For example, evidence suggests that the results of the disease in adolescents may differ from those in adults.</p>
                <p>Changes in brain structure and function are early signs of the condition.</p>
                <p>Enlargement of the ventricles of the brain is thought to be associated with starvation, and is partially reversed when normal weight is regained.</p>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Other effects may include the following:
                    <br/>
                    <br/> </p>
                <ul>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Bulimia nervosa mostly known as bulimia is an eating disorder in which you engage in recurrent binge eating followed by feelings of guilt, depression, and self-condemnation. The sufferer will then engage in compensatory behaviours to make up for the excessive eating, which are referred to as âpurgingâ.</p>
                <p>Purging can take the form of:
                    <br/>
                    <br/> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vomiting</li>
                    <li>Fasting</li>
                    <li>Laxatives</li>
                    <li>Enemas</li>
                    <li>Diuretics</li>
                    <li>Other medications</li>
                    <li>Over-exercising</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) involves disordered eating patterns. EDNOS is described in the DSM-IV-TR as a &quot;category [of] disorders of eating that do not meet the criteria for any specific eating disorder&quot;.
                    <br/>DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic Criteria â EDNOS</p>
                <p>The list above is in no way representative of what a sufferer feels or experiences living with the illness. It is important to note that you can still suffer from Bulimia even if one of the below signs are not present. In other words, if you think you have Bulimia, it's dangerous to read the diagnostic criteria and think &quot;I don't have one of the symptoms, so I must not be Bulimic&quot;.</p>
                <p>Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.</p>
                <p>A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating)</p>
                <p>1. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.</p>
                <p>2. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviours both occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months.</p>
                <p>3. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.</p>
                <p>4. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa.</p>
                <p>Purging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas</p>
                <p>Non-purging Type: during the current episode of Bulimia Nervosa, the person has used other inappropriate compensatory behaviours, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but has not regularly engaged in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p> Self-esteem reflects a person's overall evaluation or appraisal of her or his own worth.
                    <br/>The relationship that you have with yourself affects every thought and every decision that you have. It affects how you experience life and even how you âhearâ and perceive situations. If you have low self-esteem often you perceive situations, conversations from a negative filter often feeling attacked or like itâs a personal insult. This can make life very hard.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Self-esteem encompasses three aspects of your own beliefs, emotions and behaviours:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Beliefs: âI am competent/incompetentâ</p>
                <p>Emotions: triumph/despair or pride/shame</p>
                <p>Behaviour may reflect self-esteem: assertiveness/timidity, confidence/caution</p>
                <p>
                    <br/>Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension &quot;I believe I am a good at drawing, and feel proud of that in particular&quot; or have global extent, &quot;I believe I am a good person, and feel proud of myself in general&quot;.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Self-esteem can include our own sense of:
                    <br/>
                    <br/> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-worth</li>
                    <li>Self-regard</li>
                    <li>Self-respect</li>
                    <li>Self-love</li>
                    <li>Self-integrity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br/>Self-esteem is distinct from self-confidence and self-efficacy, which involve beliefs about ability and future performance.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Definition of Self-Esteem
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Nathaniel Branden in 1969 briefly defined self-esteem as:
                    <br/>âthe experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness&quot;.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Brandenâs (1969) description of self-esteem includes the following primary properties:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>1. Self-esteem as a basic human need, âit makes an essential contribution to the life process&quot;, &quot;â¦is indispensable to normal and healthy self-development, and has a value for survival.&quot;</p>
                <p>2. Self-esteem as an automatic and inevitable consequence of the sum of individuals' choices in using their consciousness</p>
                <p>3. Something experienced as a part of, or background to, all of the individuals thoughts, feelings and actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>High self-esteem correlates highly with self-reported happiness.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Therapy can help learning self-compassion and self-acceptance</p>
                <p>Perceive yourself in a true and balanced way</p>
                <p>Increase your self-esteem
                    <br/>Challenging negative self-talk and building a realistic self-belief</p>
                <p>Recovery from criticism and build resilience</p>

Malahide is served by the 42, 32a, 102 and 230 bus routes and is also on the Dart and Intercity Train Service. It is a five minute walk from Malahide train station. </P>
