                        <h4><strong>Academic Background</strong></h4>
                        <p>Allison Keating is a Chartered Psychologist of the Psychological Society of Ireland. Training includes an MSc., in Work and Organisational Psychology, BA in Behavioural Science in Psychology, Certificate in Career Guidance and Adult Counselling and is a master Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) practitioner, Life & Business Coach and accredited in EQ-i (Emotional Intelligence). Allison was invited to present her BSc. thesis "Cognitive Dissonance and the Millennium Y2K Bug" at the BRAINSTORM conference in the New York World Trade Centre in 1999. She also was invited to present her research in London to a symposium of Y2K experts. Allison follow the PSI's, Psychological Society of Ireland Professional Code of Ethics and engages in clinical supervision. </p>
                        <h4><strong>Professional Background</strong></h4>
                        <p>Allison worked as a trauma counsellor and placement officer for the FÁS Asylum Seekers Unit processing 256 asylum seekers into training, job placement and helping them through trauma for Asylum Seekers who experienced Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Allison was asked to participate in the N.D.J.T.I (North Dublin Job and Training Initiative) to assist Ireland's multinationals undergoing major change management and worked with Gateway Ireland (800 employees); Celestica (450 employees) and Aer Lingus (1600 employees) to assist their staff in determining their next career moves and to deal with the transitional stress. From here she financially managed and ran eleven North Dublin disability groups and programmes, namely the N.T.D.I; Prosper Finglas; St. Michaels House and D.E.N. at the CRC through FÁS. Having completed her Psychology undergraduate studies, Allison pursued her Masters Psychology Degree in DCU and produced a highly commended thesis entitled "An investigation into the potential effects of emotional labour on front-line staff", which analysed emotional labour, and how emotional burnout affects employees within the Irish working environment, specifically within the FÁS organisation. Allison was the Career Centre Manager at Diageo Ireland (600 employees) and worked as a consultant implementing the Career Decisions Making Programme. This is a scientifically proven method that was used to aid Diageo employees’ career progression. With the successful completion of that project she was asked to run a pilot programme under the auspices of Northside Partnership, Social Welfare and Career Decisions International called 'Enabled for Life' for people with mental, physical and emotional disabilities with excellent results. Allison ran two of these Enabled for Life programmes and the programme has now become a nationwide programme. Allison decided to establish her own clinic and worked under a franchise agreement for two years. Allison ran "a behavioural Psychology franchise" for two years and in December 2006 opened the bWell clinic. The bWell clinic works extensively with anxiety and panic disorders, relationships, depression and believes in supporting the client to realise their therapeutic expectations into genuine action. I have a major interest in de-stigmatizing mental health in Ireland. I have contributed on Psychological topics on TV3's Ireland AM, running a nine week mental health series that looked at the day to day issues I would work with at the clinic such as Panic attacks, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, phobias, social phobias, stress, family and personal relationships. I ran a ten week Positive Psychology series that looked at resilience, optimism, mindfulness, changing negative thought patterns, and many more. I was in series one and two of TV3's 'How Healthy are you? focusing on anxiety in series one and two and CBT for weight loss in series two. For all interviews and programmes you can access them in the media section. I enjoy contributing evidence based Psychology through the media and it is a personal value of mine to share good information in a time of information overload. With a six part series commissioned by RTE 2 ‘Then Comes Marriage’ myself and Ray O’Neill really enjoyed helping couples with the usual pitfalls of marriage and relationships looking at how money, sex, gender roles, conflict, communications will all present themselves at some point in your relationship. I personally loved putting love and science into bed together as we know from research the things that nurture your relationship and the sure fire relationship wreckers.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Specialities</strong></h4>
                        <p>I work extensively with anxiety and panic attacks and I see it as a hidden epidemic in Ireland. I have been very happy with results generated through innovative Positive Psychology strategies which works on a strengths based model and CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) which is a solution focused therapy. I also integrate Psychodynamics to understand how your earlier relationships may still be impacting your current behaviour(s) which lends itself to a very well rounded approach to helping you on your therapeutic journey with progressive, research driven, empathic and solutions focused therapy. The ethos of the bWell Clinic is Your Happiness and to surpass ethical and professional standards of excellence. Showing the client how to become happier and healthier and changing the therapy process into an enjoyable transition from where you are now to where you want to be. The mission statement of the bWell Clinic is to create a more authentic happiness and quality of life in all of our clients and to show them how to tap into their own potential, now and in the future. To equip the client with skills and techniques that can be used in a practical sense in everyday life. Our solution focused therapy works excellently with a psychodynamic methodology and we look forward to meeting and helping you, Allison</p>
                        <h4><strong>A bit about me</strong></h4>
                        <p>I am from Malahide, I am very grateful to be near trees, the castle, the beach and playground (not for me!). Sometimes a good walk to blow away the cobwebs down by the breezy beach and having a laugh are a great antidote to the good life. I am very lucky to have three sisters and super parents. Myself and Thomas can’t quite believe that we will celebrate our ten year wedding anniversary this year. We live and breathe our three gorgeous girls with lots of love and many sleepless nights! I love Psychology, I love how research can be applied to your daily life to make it one of great worth and purpose to you. We live in a time of so many great minds and thinkers and with unprecedented access to these people I feel there is so much opportunity within our grasp. I have always been fascinated by people and how they think, and this has only increased with being lucky enough to share in people’s deeply personal therapeutic journey. I thank all my clients for what they have shared with me, and I am humbled by the strength of the human spirit every day. It is with great pleasure that we extend a warm welcome to you on you on your personal journey</p>
