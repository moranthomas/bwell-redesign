                        <h4><strong>Academic Background</strong></h4>
                        <p>Allison Keating is a Chartered Psychologist of the Psychological Society of Ireland. Training includes a Masters and Degree in Psychology. Allison was invited to present her BSc. thesis "Cognitive Dissonance and the Millennium Bug" at the BRAINSTORM conference at the World Trade Centre, New York in 1999. She also was invited to present her research in London to a symposium of Y2K experts. Allison follow the Psychological Society of Ireland Professional Code of Ethics and engages in clinical supervision.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Professional Background</strong></h4>
                        <p>Allison worked as a trauma counsellor for the FÁS Asylum Seekers Unit processing 256 asylum seekers into training, job placement and helping them through Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Assisted employees undergoing transitioning through major change management & redundancy at Gateway Ireland (800 employees); Celestica (450 employees) and Aer Lingus (1600 employees). Masters thesis in DCU looked at burnout "An investigation into the potential effects of emotional labour on front-line staff" which is a research topic that is unfortunately becoming even more important. Career Centre Manager at Diageo Ireland (600 employees) using a career system to help identify strengths and the next best step for people. With the successful completion of that project she was asked to run a pilot programme under the auspices of Northside Partnership, Social Welfare and Career Decisions International called 'Enabled for Life' for people with mental, physical and emotional disabilities. Allison ran two of these Enabled for Life programmes and the programme has now become a nationwide programme. Allison decided to establish her own clinic and worked under a franchise agreement for two years. Allison ran "a behavioural Psychology franchise" for two years and in December 2006 opened the bWell clinic. The bWell clinic works extensively with anxiety and panic disorders, relationships, depression and cultivating good mental health. The ethos is to support the client therapeutically in a safe, evidence & strength based clinic with experienced empathetic therapists. I have a major interest in de-stigmatizing mental health and have been contributing via media since 2006. I have contributed on Psychological topics on TV3's Ireland AM over the last decade running a nine week mental health series that looked at the day to day issues I would work with at the clinic such as Panic attacks, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, phobias, social phobias, stress, family and personal relationships. I ran a ten week Positive Psychology series that looked at resilience, optimism, mindfulness, changing negative thought patterns, and many more. I was in series one and two of TV3's 'How Healthy are you?' focusing on anxiety in series one and two and CBT for weight loss in series two. I enjoy contributing evidence based Psychology through the media and it is a personal value of mine to share evidence based information in a time of information overload. RTE 2's 6 part series ‘Then Comes Marriage’ saw myself and Psychoanalyst Ray O’Neill helping couples thinking of getting married navigate the usual bumps in relationships. Really reflecting on our relationship with money, sex, gender roles, conflict & how we communicate. I loved putting love and science into bed together as we know from research the things that nurture your relationship and the sure fire relationship wreckers and I hope the programme helped people identify and change aspects of their relationship. Change is necessary and good in relationships.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Specialities</strong></h4>
                        <p>I work extensively with anxiety and panic attacks and I see it as a hidden epidemic in Ireland. I have been very happy with results generated through innovative Positive Psychology strategies which works on a strengths based model and CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) which is a solution focused therapy. I also integrate Psycho-dynamic therapy to understand how your earlier relationships may still be impacting your current behaviour(s) which lends itself to a very well rounded approach to helping you on your therapeutic journey with progressive, research driven, emphatic and solutions focused therapy. The ethos of the bWell Clinic is cultivating good mental well-being and to surpass ethical and professional standards of excellence. Showing the client how to become happier and healthier and changing the therapy process into an enjoyable transition from where you are now to where you want to be. The mission statement of the bWell Clinic is to create a more authentic happiness and quality of life in all of our clients and to show them how to tap into their own potential, now and in the future. To equip the client with skills and techniques that can be used in a practical sense in everyday life. We look forward to meeting and helping you, Allison</p>
                        <h4><strong>A bit about me</strong></h4>
                        <p>From Malahide, I am very grateful to be near the beach, the castle, and playground (not for me!) and my family. Family is number one and we live and breathe our three gorgeous girls with lots of love and many sleepless nights! I love Psychology, I love how research can be applied to your daily life to make it one of great worth and purpose to you. We live in a time of so many great minds and thinkers and with unprecedented access to these people I feel there is so much opportunity within our grasp. I have always been fascinated by people and how they think, and this has only increased with being lucky enough to share in people’s deeply personal therapeutic journey. I thank all my clients for what they have shared with me, and I am humbled by the strength of the human spirit every day. It is with great pleasure that we extend a warm welcome to you on you on your personal journey.</p>

                            </br> I encourage people to speak freely about themselves and their current lives but also about their family of origin and their memories of their childhood. Dreams are often described as ‘the royal road to the unconscious’ and therefore paying attention to, and speaking about ,your dreams is always an important part of the therapeutic process. I have always valued a particular quote by the poet Maya Angelou ‘There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you’’. Her words I hope can be a source of encouragement to anyone who is considering speaking to a therapist.’ Aside from working with adults coping with issues such as depression, (including perinatal depression), anxiety and eating disorders, Donna has considerable experience working with children and adolescents though her work in educational settings and the Youth Health Service, Cork. Through her work with adolescents she is keenly aware of the difficulties that can arise for young people with regard to sexuality, socialization and finding meaning in life. I really enjoy working with young people and children and firmly believe that early intervention and the removal of stigma around mental health is vital. </p>
