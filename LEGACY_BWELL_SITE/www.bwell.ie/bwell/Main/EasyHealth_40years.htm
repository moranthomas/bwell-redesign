Everything in my life is fine at the moment but I can’t seem to stop worrying about events that occurred many years ago. The crazy thing is that some of these events are minor and not that important. I lose sleep analysing conversations I had with people five years ago and questioning things over and over again in my head. Sometimes I think about this stuff so deeply that I end up arguing with my husband because I will remember a quarrel we had in the early stages of our relationship. I know it’s not fair to drag up past issues like this but I cannot stop my mind from wondering back into past events. Can you help me?</B></SPAN></SPAN></DIV><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><DIV></DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class=verysmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=CF-Page-Text><TD><SPAN edesc><B>A:</B> Hi and thanks for writing in. Sometimes it’s hard to read between the lines where there are knowledge gaps as to the experiences that you have experienced. So I am going to go by the feeling that comes from your question, and I hope that it is right for you. Firstly, you have just turned 40, I wonder if this was a significant milestone for you. I have found that the beginning of every decade usually brings about a personal audit where you take a step outside and see where you are in your life and how it is for you. This can present as a mid-life crisis but I see them more as a mid-life transition because it is useful to question our sense of purpose and meaning in life and to question who you are at this point in time. Often hitting a milestone like forty, will make you look at your expectations of how you thought you would be at forty. If you have not reached ‘perceived milestones’ or if there is a gap between how you are and how you would like to be it can create disappointment, sadness and anger. <BR><BR>You say that everything in your life is fine at the moment. I wonder have there been periods where this was not the case? It seems like you expect things to turn bad again? As if this good phase may be over again soon? You are deep in the habit of ruminating. This nasty habit has us on a mental gerbil wheel where we re-hash and go over again and again conversations and unresolved issues. I always thought unfinished business was an interesting word, I think it can sometimes mean it didn’t work out the way you wanted it to. But, it seems something is not sitting in your unconscious well and from what you have said it seems like you are still feeling perhaps hurt and angry. As a psychologist one word clients say that make my alarm bells go off is ‘this is really silly, or this sounds really stupid.’ In other words the person is saying I shouldn’t be upset by this and others have perhaps said the same thing, but the fact of the matter is, there is real hurt. <BR><BR>We live in a society now that you may think we have all the psychology buzz words, our colloquial language uses words like ego, self-esteem, he’s just projecting onto you, they are just being passive aggressive etc. The true meaning of these words often been misinterpreted and misunderstood. With people putting on their Psychology hats they sometimes can do more damage than good. This can happen when someone shuts down your feelings and doesn’t ‘allow’ you to express how you feel. By the way, this is the art of active listening, that you well, just listen. Perhaps you have been told by others that you need to just ‘get over this’ and now you feel the same way as well. I would like for you to give yourself permission to write out all the past events that seem to be still lingering in your everyday consciousness. Do this is private, give yourself space to bring up the feelings that are on the surface anyway. Freely write out what happened and why it hurt you. You may be surprised by what it is that has genuinely upset you. I find this tool an incredibly helpful and revelatory intervention to gain an insight into your real feelings. The idea is to respect the emotion that is coming up for you. To acknowledge it and then to do the necessary work with it, which may require you to talk with your husband about some unresolved issues that you are still feeling. When we hold onto these emotions that many manifest in what seems to others to be an over-reaction. For example he may leave his coffee cup on the counter, again, and you blow a fuse. I am not encouraging you to let loose on every minor discrepancy from friends and family but, you do need to give the issues and feelings airtime. <BR><BR>Upon completion of the events that have caused issue, you may find that the event still is minor but what it meant to you was much more significant. You say that some of these events happened at the beginning of your relationship. What was going on at that time? Did something happen or not happen that lead to you feeling unloved and or unsupported?<BR><BR>You mention that you worry a lot, are you finding that you are in a negative cycle at the moment. A useful book called ‘Learned Optimism’ by Dr. Martin Seligman teaches you how to change your thinking from pessimism to being optimistic. Again optimism has over used as a colloquialism and it’s true meaning has not only been lost but damaged. An optimist when faced with a problem is specific, whereas the pessimist is general, the optimist is able to see that it is not personal and it will not always last and these are good decision making faculties to incorporate into your thinking toolbox. <BR><BR>I wonder how your self-esteem is? How do you view yourself? The word rumination comes from how cows constantly re-chew their food. For us humans it is very destructive and linked to depression. When you persistently dwell on upsetting events from the past it can create negative automatic thoughts. These intrusive thoughts can be exhausting and deplete you physically and emotionally which can add to hampering your ability to solve problems. This can further fuel a negative self-concept and can leave you feeling like you are not in control. <BR><BR>Ok, so what can you do about this? Well, like everything it takes a commitment to become aware of these thoughts, and you may think that you are and that you think of nothing else, it even keeps you awake at night. But I am coming from a solution focused CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) point of view rather than an analytical focus. CBT puts the control back into your hands. Rumination especially over past events, conversations leads to analysis to paralysis. If someone didn’t say hello to you 'what did that mean?' or the non stop picking over your every word and action, typically affecting women more so than men really dampens confidence and self-belief. <BR></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD><TD style="BORDER-LEFT: #e1e0e0 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 19px; PADDING-RIGHT: 16px" vAlign=top width=425 align=right><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%" align=right vAlign="top"><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class=verysmall>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD vAlign=top align=middle><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text><IMG title="" border=0 alt="" src="../Images/AllisonKeating.jpg"></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR class=verysmall><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR vAlign=top><TD style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 29px; PADDING-LEFT: 29px; PADDING-RIGHT: 29px; PADDING-TOP: 29px" class=BgLoseWeightPale width="100%"><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"><TBODY><TR><TD><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text>Circular questions such as ‘why did he say that’ or ‘what did she really mean when she said that’ are the nasty specter of a ruminators. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, the chair of the department of psychology at Yale University and the author of Women Who Think Too Much: How to Break Free of Overthinking and Reclaim Your Life says you won’t find the answers as to why. I have to agree with Susan, when people come to therapy they think when they understand the 'why' then the healing will come. This is not the case, when you go to the Doctor and you are told you have the flu and you ask yourself why? The answer could be because the weather is changing and you forgot your coat the other day and got caught in the rain. Here’s the million euro question, does knowing 'why' you have the flu, take away the fact that you do in fact have the flu! No, and the same ideology is present with your mental health. It is the 'how' are you going to get better that needs to be your first point of reference and most importantly 'what' do you need to do.<BR><BR>Don’t think that you can ignore it, if you could do that then you wouldn’t be writing into me. Secondly, don’t try put a superficial plaster on it with happy thoughts, this will make the gap between how you feel and reality even more glaringly obvious. Worrying and ruminating are not one in the same. Worry normally is future bound and ruminating is normally fixated on past events so this is why I am outlining the following 6 steps to stop your habit of ruminating. <BR><BR>Bruce Hubbard, the director of the Cognitive Health Group and an adjunct assistant professor of psychology and education at Columbia University says that 'simply telling yourself stop is like pushing a beach ball under the water. The harder you push, the farther it will pop up” so with that in mind here’s what you need to do:<BR><BR><B>Step 1: If You Can, Take Action</B><BR><BR>Hubbard states 'that ruminators can get stuck at the analysis phase of the problem'. So as I mentioned above be specific and write out how this could be turned into a solution. Reframe the event, do you have all the facts? How do you know for sure what the other person thought when you said a particular comment. Remember not to over rely on the faulty idea that you 'know' what they thought. Remember you are most probably not a mindreader, so resist the urge to do this. This is a fatal thinking error people often engage in. If you feel you did say something wrong, even if it was years ago, could you apologize?<BR><BR><B>Step 2: Challenge Your Beliefs</B><BR>A nice technique is to put your thoughts on trial, you effectively cross examine and dispute your beliefs. Do you have all the facts? How do you know for sure, is it opinion or fact? I use this extensively with clients and a useful CBT technique for this is the ABCDE model <BR><BR><B>Step 3: Redirect Your Attention</B><BR>An activity that combines mental engagement and social contact, such as a game of tennis or a brisk walk with a friend will keep your thoughts on track. Whereas something less engaging a boring soap on tv may create a negative u-turn back to rumination street.<BR><BR><B>Step 4: Resist the Urge to “Talk It Out”</B><BR>This is interesting because so many positives are normally associated with chatting it out especially with a good friend. In terms of rumination this is not a good antidote. Because the chat can lead to a lot of micro-analysing and dissection and an increase in this circular negative reasoning has in studies been linked with an increase in the stress hormone cortisol when co-ruminating with a friend.<BR><BR><B>Step 5: Observe Mindfulness</B><BR>This will not change you having the negative past thoughts but as you observe them and accept them as they are in that moment this space can allow you watch them leave. Jon Kabat-Zinn's book on mindfulness 'Full Catastrophe Living' is a super tightly formatted blend of Eastern philosophy with the how-to of Western Psychology is a great starting point based on the Mindfulness stress reduction programme at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.<BR><BR><B>Step 6: Be Patient</B><BR>One major question I always ask is 'how patient are you'. To cultivate a healthier way of thinking requires commitment, effort and consistency. You will need patience because the habit of rumination is one that needs to be monitored and acted upon. If this is too difficult I would recommend talking with a mental health practitioner. <BR><BR>You need to be proud of taking the first step which is to realize that you are not happy with how you are thinking at the moment. You don't like it, you can see how destructive it is so the next step is to do something about it. Well done for taking the first step, I hope the information above will direct you on a path to a more contented peaceful mind. <BR></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class=CF-Page-Text><B>bWell Tip:</B> To create great sleep hygiene, go to bed at the same time each night.
